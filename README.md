# simple-speed-log

Two shell scripts which can be run on any device with Python and
[Miller][1]. You'll need to install [speedtest-cli][2] from `pip`.

`./monitor` is a shell script that calls `speedtest` and waits a random
number of seconds, up to one hour, before doing the next test.  It can be
run in `screen` on embedded platforms where `cron` may not be available or
reliable. Each test is logged to `speed.log` in CSV format.

`./view` is a shell script that calls `mlr` and dumps the most interesting
parts of `speed.log` in a nice format.

## Setup

Create and enter a virtualenv:

`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`

Install `speedtest-cli`:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To wipe out the sample data I am storing in the repo:

`speedtest --csv-header > speed.log`

Otherwise, just invoke `./view` or `./monitor`:

```
λ ./view
